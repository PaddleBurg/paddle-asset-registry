## README for asset-registry repository

This repository documents the Management Assignments for the MakerDAO Intangible Asset owned by Dai Foundation. 

If you want to ask for Management control over a MakerDAO intangible asset please create an Intangible Asset Agreed Modification of Management request as documented in MIP60 https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip60-intangible-asset-assignment/10319

To update parameters for assets for which you ALREADY have Management control assigned please use https://change.daifoundation.org

Dai Foundation Asset Registry records are updated by the TechOps core unit on behalf of Dai Foundation in the Google Sheet located at https://assets.daifoundation.org. The records are subsequently published to this github repository to enable the use of github to track changes in asset assignments.

If you own MakerDAO intangible assets please hand them over to Dai Foundation to ensure that they remain public goods for which management is controlled by Maker Governance. Please contact support@daifoundation.org or the Dai Foundation core unit facilitator if you hold assets that should be under Management control by Maker Governance.
